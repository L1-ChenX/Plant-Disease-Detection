            In modern agricultural production, the severity of diseases is an important factor that directly affects the yield and quality of plants. In order to effectively monitor and control the entire production process of plants, not only the type of disease, but also the severity of the disease must be clarified. In recent years, deep learning for plant disease species identification has been widely used. In particular, the application of convolutional neural network (CNN) to plant disease images has made breakthrough progress. However, there are relatively few studies on disease severity assessment. The group first traced the prevailing views of existing disease researchers to provide criteria for grading the severity of plant diseases. Then, depending on the network architecture, this study outlined 16 studies on CNN-based plant disease severity assessment in terms of classical CNN frameworks, improved CNN architectures and CNN-based segmentation networks, and provided a detailed comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each. Common methods for acquiring datasets and performance evaluation metrics for CNN models were investigated. Finally, this study discussed the major challenges faced by CNN-based plant disease severity assessment methods in practical applications, and provided feasible research ideas and possible solutions to address these challenges.},

	abstract = {Deep learning is a branch of artiﬁcial intelligence. In recent years, with the advantages of automatic learning and feature extraction, it has been widely concerned by academic and industrial circles. It has been widely used in image and video processing, voice processing, and natural language processing. At the same time, it has also become a research hotspot in the ﬁeld of agricultural plant protection, such as plant disease recognition and pest range assessment, etc. The application of deep learning in plant disease recognition can avoid the disadvantages caused by artiﬁcial selection of disease spot features, make plant disease feature extraction more objective, and improve the research efﬁciency and technology transformation speed. This review provides the research progress of deep learning technology in the ﬁeld of crop leaf disease identiﬁcation in recent years. In this paper, we present the current trends and challenges for the detection of plant leaf disease using deep learning and advanced imaging techniques. We hope that this work will be a valuable resource for researchers who study the detection of plant diseases and insect pests. At the same time, we also discussed some of the current challenges and problems that need to be resolved.},

Convolutional neural network, particularly deep learning is used widely in machine vision and pattern recognition task. Researchers proposed different deep learning models in the identiﬁcation of diseases in plants. However, the deep learning models require a large number of parameters, and hence the required training time is more and also difﬁcult to implement on small devices. In this paper, we have proposed a novel deep learning model based on the inception layer and residual connection. Depthwise separable convolution is used to reduce the number of parameters. The proposed model has been trained and tested on three different plant diseases datasets. The performance accuracy obtained on plantvillage dataset is 99.39\%, on the rice disease dataset is 99.66\%, and on the cassava dataset is 76.59\%. With fewer number of parameters, the proposed model achieves higher accuracy in comparison with the state-of-art deep learning models.},

	abstract = {Tomato is an important vegetable crop cultivated worldwide coming next only to potato. However, the crop can be damaged due to various diseases. It is important for the farmer to know the type of disease for timely treatment of the crop. It has been observed that leaves are clear indicator of speciﬁc diseases. A number of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models have been proposed in literature for identiﬁcation of tomato crop diseases. CNN models are based on Deep Learning Neural Networks and differ inherently from traditional Machine Learning algorithms like k-NN, DecisionTrees etc. While pretrained CNN models perform fairly well, they tend to be computationally heavy due to large number of parameters involved. In this paper a simpliﬁed CNN model is proposed comprising of 8 hidden layers. Using the publicly available dataset PlantVillage, proposed light weight model performs better than the traditional machine learning approaches as well as pretrained models and achieves an accuracy of 98.4\%. PlantVillage dataset comprises of 39 classes of different crops like apple, potato, corn, grapes etc. of which 10 classes are of tomato diseases. While traditional ML methods gives best accuracy of 94.9\% with k-NN, best accuracy of 93.5\% is obtained with VGG16 in pretrained models. To increase performance of proposed CNN, image pre-processing has been used by changing image brightness by a random value of a random width of image after image augmentation. The proposed model also performs extremely well on dataset other than PlantVillage with accuracy of 98.7\%.},

Traditional disease detection methods rely on extracting handcrafted features from the acquired images to identify the type of infection. Also, the performance of these works solely depends on the nature of the handcrafted features selected. This can be addressed by learning the features automatically with the help of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This research presents two different deep architectures for detecting the type of infection in tomato leaves. The first architecture applies residual learning to learn significant features for classification. The second architecture applies attention mechanism on top of the residual deep network. Experiments were conducted using Plant Village Dataset comprising of three diseases namely early blight, late blight, and leaf mold. The proposed work exploited the features learned by the CNN at various processing hierarchy using the attention mechanism and achieved an overall accuracy of 98\% on the validation sets in the 5-fold cross-validation.},

	abstract = {Plant disease is a significant threat to food security and subsistence farmers. Despite the rapid development of automatic recognition of plant disease under controlled laboratory conditions since the employment of deep learning technology, it is still quite challenging to distinguish plant disease under uncontrolled field conditions. In this paper, based on a backbone convolutional neural network (CNN), we propose an improved CNN model towards field plant disease recognition (FPDR) by exploring the potential and generalization capabilities of the CNN model. To train the model, we propose background replacing to make the model more robust to background distraction, and leaf resizing to deal with inconsistent size and location of disease symptoms. Both background replacing and leaf resizing are used as data augmentation methods of the improved model. To further enhance the feature discriminativeness, we propose channel orthogonal constraint to improve the ability of feature to distinguish similar categories, and utilize species information as an auxiliary species classification task. In addition, we collect 665 plant disease images under field conditions, namely Field-PlantVillage (Field-PV) to remedy for lack of in-the-field images. The Field-PV is only used as an independent test set to evaluate the performance of the method applied to FPDR. Our improved CNN model improves the FPDR accuracy on Field-PV from 41.81\% to 72.03\%, though only the PlantVillage dataset is used for training. Experimental result on the PlantVillage achieves the state of the art performance (99.84\%). Code and data are available at https://github.co m/PatrickGui/FPDR/tree/master.},

The symptom images were segmented from cucumber leaf images captured under ﬁeld conditions. In order to decrease the chance of overﬁtting, data augmentation methods were utilized to enlarge the datasets formed by the segmented symptom images. With the augmented datasets containing 14,208 symptom images, the DCNN achieved good recognition results, with an accuracy of 93.4\%. In order to compare the results of the DCNN, comparative experiments were conducted using conventional classiﬁers (Random Forest and Support Vector Machines), as well as AlexNet. Results showed that the DCNN was a robust tool for recognizing the cucumber diseases in ﬁeld conditions.},

A considerable number of studies have investigated the potential of deep learning techniques for precision agriculture in the last decade. However, despite the range of applications, several gaps within plant disease research are yet to be addressed to support disease management on farms. Thus, there is a need to establish a knowledge base of existing applications and identify the challenges and opportunities to help advance the development of tools that address farmers’ needs. This study presents a comprehensive overview of 70 studies on deep learning applications and the trends associated with their use for disease diagnosis and management in agriculture.

	abstract = {Plant leaves can be used to effectively detect plant diseases. However, the number of images of unhealthy leaves collected from various plants is usually unbalanced. It is difﬁcult to detect diseases using such an unbalanced dataset. We used DoubleGAN (a double generative adversarial network) to generate images of unhealthy plant leaves to balance such datasets. We proposed using DoubleGAN to generate high-resolution images of unhealthy leaves using fewer samples. DoubleGAN is divided into two stages. In stage 1, we used healthy leaves and unhealthy leaves as inputs. First, the healthy leaf images were used as inputs for the WGAN (Wasserstein generative adversarial network) to obtain the pretrained model. Then, unhealthy leaves were used for the pretrained model to generate 64 64 pixel images of unhealthy leaves. In stage 2, a superresolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) was used to obtain corresponding 256 256 pixel images to expand the unbalanced dataset. Finally, compared with images generated by DCGAN (Deep convolution generative adversarial network). The dataset expanded with DoubleGAN, the generated images are clearer than DCGAN, and the accuracy of plant species and disease recognition reached 99.80 and 99.53 percent, respectively. The recognition results are better than those from the original dataset.},

	abstract = {Many applications for the automated diagnosis of plant disease have been developed based on the success of deep learning techniques. However, these applications often suffer from overﬁtting, and the diagnostic performance is drastically decreased when used on test data sets from new environments. In this article, we propose LeafGAN, a novel image-to-image translation system with own attention mechanism. LeafGAN generates a wide variety of diseased images via transformation from healthy images, as a data augmentation tool for improving the performance of plant disease diagnosis. Due to its own attention mechanism, our model can transform only relevant areas from images with a variety of backgrounds, thus enriching the versatility of the training images. Experiments with ﬁve-class cucumber disease classiﬁcation show that data augmentation with vanilla CycleGAN cannot help to improve the generalization, i.e., disease diagnostic performance increased by only 0.7\% from the baseline. In contrast, LeafGAN boosted the diagnostic performance by 7.4\%. We also visually conﬁrmed that the generated images by our LeafGAN were much better quality and more convincing than those generated by vanilla CycleGAN.

Farmers experience great difficulties in switching from one disease control policy to another. The naked eye observation of experts is the traditional approach adopted in practice for detection and identification of plant diseases. In this paper we review the need of simple plant leaves disease detection system that would facilitate advancements in agriculture. Early information on crop health and disease detection can facilitate the control of diseases through proper management strategies. This technique will improves productivity of crops. This paper also compares the benefits and limitations of these potential methods. It includes several steps viz. image acquisition, image pre-processing, features extraction and neural network based classification.},

The concept of pathogen severity, deﬁned as the quantitative measurement of the amount of pathogen per sampling unit has also emerged in response to the now commonplace development of quantitative molecular detection tools. Although the concept of disease severity, i.e., the amount of disease per sampling unit, is a well-established concept, the accuracy and precision of visual estimates of disease severity is often questioned. This article will review disease assessment concepts, as well as the methods and assessment aides currently available to improve the accuracy and precision of visually-based disease severity data. The accuracy and precision of visual disease severity assessments can be improved by quantitatively measuring and comparing the accuracy and precision of rates and/or assessment methods using linear regression, by using computer-based disease assessment training programmes, and by developing and using diagrammatic keys (standard area diagrams).},

Future plant disease management should aim to strengthen food security for a stable society while simultaneously safeguarding the health of associated ecosystems and reducing dependency on natural resources. To achieve these multiple functionalities, sustainable plant disease management should place emphases on rational adaptation of resistance, avoidance, elimination and remediation strategies individually and collectively, guided by traits of specific host-pathogen associations using evolutionary ecology principles to create environmental (biotic and abiotic) conditions favorable for host growth and development while adverse to pathogen reproduction and evolution.},

However, the prevailing approach has shifted to the application of deep learning concepts, with focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In general, this kind of technique requires large datasets containing a wide variety of conditions to work properly. This is an important limitation, given the many challenges involved in the construction of a suitable image database. In this context, this study investigates how the size and variety of the datasets impact the eﬀectiveness of deep learning techniques applied to plant pathology. This investigation was based on an image database containing 12 plant species, each presenting very diﬀerent characteristics in terms of number of samples, number of diseases and variety of conditions. Experimental results indicate that while the technical constraints linked to automatic plant disease classiﬁcation have been largely overcome, the use of limited image datasets for training brings many undesirable consequences that still prevent the eﬀective dissemination of this type of technology.},

We hypothesised that given the characteristics of the images, there should be a subset of features more informative of the image domain. To test this hypothesis, several classiﬁcation models were assessed via cross-validation. The results of this study suggested that: texture-related features might be used as discriminators when the target images do not follow a well deﬁned colour or shape domain pattern; and that machine vision systems might lead to the successful discrimination of targets when fed with appropriate information.},

India is the third largest producer of cardamom. Plant diseases cause a catastrophic inﬂuence on food production safety; they reduce the eminence and quantum of agricultural products. Plant diseases may cause signiﬁcantly high loss or no harvest in dreadful cases. Various diseases and pests affect the growth of cardamom plants at different stages and crop yields. This study concentrated on two diseases of cardamom plants, Colletotrichum Blight and Phyllosticta Leaf Spot of cardamom and three diseases of grape, Black Rot, ESCA, and Isariopsis Leaf Spot. Various methods have been proposed for plant disease detection, and deep learning has become the preferred method because of its spectacular accomplishment. In this study, U2-Net was used to remove the unwanted background of an input image by selecting multiscale features. This work proposes a cardamom plant disease detection approach using the EfﬁcientNetV2 model. A comprehensive set of experiments was carried out to ascertain the performance of the proposed approach and compare it with other models such as EfﬁcientNet and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
